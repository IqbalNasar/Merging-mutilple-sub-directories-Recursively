# Merging-mutilple-sub-directories-Recursively
This Python code merges subdirectories recursively.
We have dataset of Breast Cancer Images. 
The main directory is diveded into sub-directories. i-e Benign and Malignant
Every sub-directory is further diveded into more sub directories. i-e 
B  = Benign(Adenosis, Fibroadenoma, Tubular Adenoma, Phyllodes Tumor)
M  = Malignant(Ductal Carcinoma, Lobular Carcinoma, Mucinous Carcinoma (Colloid), Papillary Carcinoma)
Each of these subdirectories are fuether divede into more directories. 
This code uses recursion to loop throgh all subdirectires and move the images inside them to new folder.
The new folder will only be consisted of two directories i-e Benign and Malignant and will contain all the images.
